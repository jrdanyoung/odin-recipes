      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine being able to munch as many crunchy snacks as you want while
        you're binging that show you love and feeling great about it! That's the
        beauty of these homemade baked kale chips. Made by quickly tossing
        together three simple ingredients — fresh kale, olive oil, and flaked
        sea salt — and baked low and slow for only 20 minutes, these crispy kale
        chips are easy to make, there are no mystery additives, and even fussy
        eaters snap them up.

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a rimmed
          baking sheet with parchment paper.
        </li>

        <li>
          Remove kale leaves carefully from thick stems using a knife or kitchen
          shears; tear into bite-sized pieces.
        </li>
        <li>Wash and thoroughly dry kale with a salad spinner.</li>
        <li>
          Drizzle kale leaves with olive oil; toss to coat. Spread leaves in an
          even layer on the prepared baking sheet without overlapping; sprinkle
          with salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until edges start to brown but are not
          burnt, 20 to 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
